Welcome to the SASHA Code Base!

SASHA is an open source version of an Amazon Echo (Alexa) like project BUT Open Source,
FREE, make it for any Linux-capable device (e.g. Raspberry Pi's, Mbed Boards,
TI Dev. Boards, or even your home PC, etc)...

If you don't want to build your own, you can support this project by buying
Pre-Made devices that will be 3D Printed & built with high quality parts OR
cheap models for those who want something light weight & fun to have. 


This project is going to be great for your homemade IoT products that need
that extra feature... Also Sasha's IoT will be able to be controlled via 
mobile anywhere in the world ðŸ—º.
